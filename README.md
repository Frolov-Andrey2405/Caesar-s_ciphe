# Caesar's Cipher Encryption and Decryption

Experience the intrigue of ancient cryptography with Caesar's Cipher â€“ an encryption algorithm famously used by Julius Caesar. Encrypt your messages by shifting the letters a certain number of positions in the alphabet, known as the key. Decryption is achieved by reversing the shift. This program lets you explore both encryption and decryption processes using the Caesar's Cipher algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
3. Enter the message you wish to process.
4. Provide the encryption key (shift distance) to begin the transformation.
5. Receive your encrypted or decrypted message based on your chosen operation.

## Features

- Encrypt messages by shifting letters based on the selected key.
- Decrypt messages by applying the reverse shift to the encrypted characters.
- Simple interface for interacting with the program.
- Experience the historical encryption technique firsthand.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python caesar_cipher.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your message.

## Example

Suppose you want to encrypt the message "HELLO" with a key of 3:

- H -> K
- E -> H
- L -> O
- L -> O
- O -> R

So, "HELLO" encrypted with a key of 3 becomes "KHOOR".
